# VBISP-Code

This repository displays code from my research during the 2021 [Vanderbilt Biomedical Informatics Summer Program](https://t.e2ma.net/message/t444jf/12cgjjq). 
- Please view the attached abstract for a more concise summary.
- [More information on the program](https://www.vumc.org/dbmi/summer-research-internship-program-biomedical-informatics).

### *Initial_Dataset_Preprocessing*
For privacy reasons, I cannot share the dataset (collection of clinical notes), nor the actual notebooks used for the preprocessing of the data; however, Iâ€™ve selected a few snippets that were particularly useful. 
- The sample notebook contains more informative comments while the pdf is just aesthetically pleasing. 

### *Further_Dataset_Preprocessing*
Same story here. 

### *Sample BERT* 
I've shared the original notebooks as they do not contain any sensitive data.
