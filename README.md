# VBISP-Code

This repository displays code from my research during the 2021 [Vanderbilt Biomedical Informatics Summer Program] (https://t.e2ma.net/message/t444jf/12cgjjq). Please view the attached abstract for a more concise summary.

For privacy reasons, I cannot share the dataset (collection of clinical notes), nor the actual notebooks used for the preprocessing of the data; however, I’ve selected a few snippets that were particularly useful. Please see the notebooks for more informative comments.
